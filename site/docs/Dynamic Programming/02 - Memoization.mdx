  <title>Memoization | Dynamic Programming</title>
</head>

As the name suggests, memoization is a technique to take memo of the results to reduce computation.
This is particularly useful because of the overlapping subproblems in dynamic programming.

## Overlapping Subproblems in Fibonacci Sequence

In Fibonacci sequence, if we try to expand the larger of the two terms of the $n$-th Fibonacci number,
we will see that $f(n - 2)$ is used twice.

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(n) &= f(n - 1) + f(n - 2) \\
&= \underline{f(n - 2)} + f(n - 3) + \underline{f(n - 2)}
\end{aligned}
$$

Because the recursion tree of the Fibonacci sequence problem is a binary tree,
the number of recursive calls is $O(2^n)$, which is exponential.
So as $n$ grows, the number of overlapping subproblems and thus repeated computation also grows exponentially.

Time complexity grows with $O(2^n)$. Yellow nodes represent repeated computation on overlapping subproblems.

An exponential growth in time complexity is really bad, so we need to find a way to optimize it,
and memoization is one of the ways to do so.

## Applying Memoization

As mentioned before, memoization is simply making memo of the results.
In other words, we can store the results in memory when we first compute it, and use it when we need it again.
This is generally done by using an array or a hash table.

For an implementation in the Fibonacci sequence problem, we will use an array $\text{dp}$ to store the results.

We will first check whether we have already stored the result in $\text{dp}$ before doing any computation,
and if we have, we will simply return the result. Otherwise, compute the result and store it in $\text{dp}$.

```pseudocode title="n-th Fibonacci Number with Memoization"
// initialize the memoization array
let dp = [null, null, ..., null] of size n + 1
let dp[0] = 0
let dp[1] = 1

// fibonacci function
function fib(n: int) -> int {
    // check if we have the memoized result
    if dp[n] is not null { return dp[n] }

    // compute the result
    dp[n] = fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
    return dp[n]
}
```

If we try to visualize the recursion tree of the above algorithm, we can see that it only has $n$ nodes,
and each subproblem is only computed once. This reduces the time complexity to only $O(n)$.

<VideoPlayer src={require('/video/dp/dp_02_02.mp4').default}>

Time complexity grows with $O(n)$. The repeated computations are eliminated by directly taking stored results in $\text{dp}$.

### Multiple Calls Optimization

In the previous implementation, we assumed only one call to the function with a known $n$.

If we want to call the function multiple times, e.g. $f(7)$, then $f(13)$, then $f(10)$,
we will recompute the results of $f(0)$ to $f(7)$ three times in total.
This is because we reinitialized $\text{dp}$ to all nulls every time we run the algorithm.

To further optimize this, we make $\text{dp}$ an array shared by all calls to the function and grow the array as needed,
which reduces the average time complexity of the solution if multiple calls are made.

```pseudocode title="n-th Fibonacci Number with Memoization - Additional Optimization"
// initialize the memoization array
let dp = [0, 1]

// fibonacci function
function fib(n: int) -> int {
    // grow the array if needed
    if dp.length <= n { dp.resize(n + 1, filled with null) }

    // check if we have the memoized result
    if dp[n] is not null: return dp[n]

    // compute the result
    dp[n] = fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
    return dp[n]
}
```

In memoization, we can make extra use of what to reduce the number of computations on overlapping subproblems?

## Implementation

In Python, the implementation is almost the same as the pseudocode above, 
so it can be easily implemented as follows.

```python title="n-th Fibonacci Number with Memoization"
# initialize the memoization list
dp = [0, 1]

# fibonacci function
def fib(n):
    # grow the list if needed
    if len(dp) <= n:
        dp.extend([None] * (n + 1 - len(dp)))
        
    # check if we have the memoized result
    if dp[n] is not None:
        return dp[n]

    # compute the result
    dp[n] = fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
    return dp[n]

# main function
def main():
    # gets input and prints the result
    n = int(input())
    print(fib(n))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value='cpp' label='C++'>

In C++, there are a lot of ways to implement memoization for the Fibonacci sequence problem.
In a more simple implementation, we can represent null by a special value, such as $-1$,
and use a global vector to store the results.

```cpp title="n-th Fibonacci Number with Memoization - Simple Implementation"
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

// initialize the memoization vector
std::vector<int> dp = { 0, 1 };

// fibonacci function
int fib(int n) {
    // grow the vector if needed
    if (dp.size() <= n) {
        dp.resize(n + 1, -1);
    }

    // check if we have the memoized result
    if (dp[n] != -1) {
        return dp[n];
    }

    // compute the result
    dp[n] = fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
    return dp[n];
}

// main function
int main() {
    // gets input and prints the result
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;
    std::cout << fib(n) << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

However, this implementation has some drawbacks:
1. Using a global variable is not a good practice, we should instead encapsulate the memoization vector.
    - We can use a class.
    - We can also use a static variable inside the function, which is what we are going to use in the following example.
2. This is less important, but instead of using $-1$ to represent a null value, we can use the `std::optional` class introduced in C++17.
    - This also allows us to use unsigned integers, which is more appropriate for the problem.

```cpp title="n-th Fibonacci Number with Memoization - Better Implementation"
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <optional>

// fibonacci function
std::size_t fib(std::size_t n) {
    // initialize the memoization vector
    static std::vector<std::optional<std::size_t>> dp = { 0, 1 };

    // grow the vector if needed
    if (dp.size() <= n) {
        dp.resize(n + 1, std::nullopt);
    }

    // check if we have the memoized result
    if (dp[n].has_value()) {
        return dp[n].value();
    }

    // compute the result
    dp[n] = fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
    return dp[n].value();
}

// main function
int main() {
    // gets input and prints the result
    std::size_t n;
    std::cin >> n;
    std::cout << fib(n) << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

<TabItem value='rust' label='Rust'>

In Rust, due to the ownership system, we cannot use a static variable to store the memoization vector.
We can use a struct instead.

```rust title="n-th Fibonacci Number with Memoization - No Global Variable"
// Fib struct
struct Fib {
    dp: Vec<Option<usize>>,
}

// implementation for Fib struct
impl Fib {
    // initialize the memoization vector
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            dp: vec![Some(0), Some(1)],
        }
    }

    // fibonacci function
    pub fn fib(&mut self, n: usize) -> usize {
        // grow the array if needed
        if self.dp.len() <= n {
            self.dp.resize(n + 1, None);
        }

        // check if we have the memoized result
        match self.dp[n] {
            Some(x) => x,
            None => {
                //compute the result
                self.dp[n] = Some(self.fib(n - 1) + self.fib(n - 2));
                self.dp[n].unwrap()
            }
        }
    }
}

// main function
fn main() {
    // prints the result for fib(7)
    let n = 7;
    let mut fib = Fib::new();
    println!("{}", fib.fib(n));
}
```

However, the caller may initialize multiple instance of `Fib`, which is not very good.
In the example below, we will use the `lazy_static` crate and the `Mutex` class to initialize the static memoization vector, as a singleton.

:::info Ownership & Singleton Pattern in Rust

Because of the ownership system in Rust, we cannot make a singleton easily. There are crates like `lazy_static` allowing us to initialize 
a static variable at run-time, but it is still not possible to mutate the variable. We can use `Mutex` to provide single-thread access to
the singleton, and there are other ways to provide multi-thread access such as `RwLock`.

:::

```rust title="n-th Fibonacci Number with Memoization - With Static Variable"
use std::sync::Mutex;
use lazy_static::lazy_static;

// initialize the memoization vector
lazy_static! {
    static ref DP: Mutex<Vec<Option<usize>>> = Mutex::new(vec![Some(0), Some(1)]);
}

// fibonacci function
fn fib(n: usize) -> usize {
    // grow the vector if needed
    if DP.lock().unwrap().len() <= n {
        DP.lock().unwrap().resize(n + 1, None);
    }

    // check if we have the memoized result
    let x = DP.lock().unwrap()[n].clone();
    match x {
        Some(x) => x,
        None => {
            //compute the result
            DP.lock().unwrap()[n] = Some(fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2));
            DP.lock().unwrap()[n].unwrap()
        }
    }
}

// main function
fn main() {
    // prints the result for fib(7)
    let n = 7;
    println!("{}", fib(n));
}
```
