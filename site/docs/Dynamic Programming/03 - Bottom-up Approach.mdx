  <title>Bottom-up Approach | Dynamic Programming</title>
</head>

Compared to the top-down approach, generally recursion, the bottom-up approach reduces the overhead of function calls.
It requires starting from base cases and working up the recursion tree, which can be transformed into an iterative solution to the problem easily.

Given the benefits of the bottom-up approach, it is often the preferred approach in dynamic programming.

## Starting From The Base Cases

If we think about the recursion tree of a Fibonacci sequence problem, we can see that each $f(n)$ calls $f(n-1)$ and $f(n-2)$,
until it reaches the base cases $f(0)$ and $f(1)$.

Essentially, the recursive solution is going from top to bottom by function calls,
and then going from bottom to top by returning values.

Since we know the base cases, we can start from there and build up the solution to the problem. 

For example, we can find $f(2)$ by adding $f(0)$ and $f(1)$, and then $f(3)$ by adding $f(1)$ and $f(2)$, and so on,
until we reach the ultimate goal $f(n)$. This eliminates any function calls, and we can easily transform it into an iterative solution.

## Applying The Bottom-up Approach

As we need to calculate next values based on the previous values, we use an array to store the values we have calculated so far.
This is similar to memoization, except we don't need a null value in array or a hash table, because we know that the previous values must be 
calculated before the next values.

In the Fibonacci sequence problem, notice how the recurrence contains only one varying parameter $n$.

$$
f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)
$$

This means that we only need a one-dimensional array to store the values, starting from $n = 0$ and $n = 1$.
We can then calculate the next values by adding the previous two values in the array.

```pseudocode title="n-th Fibonacci Number with Bottom-up Approach"
// fibonacci function
function fib(n: int) -> int:
    // initialize memoization array
    let dp = [...] of size n + 1
    let dp[0] = 0
    let dp[1] = 1

    // calculate next values
    for i from 2 to n:
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]

    return dp[n]
```

This approach gives us a time complexity of $O(n)$ and a space complexity of $O(n)$, which is the same as memoization, except we don't need recursive calls.

### Space Optimization

Since we only need the previous two values to calculate the next value, we can use two variables instead of an array to store the values.
Note that there is an exceptional case for $f(0)$.

```pseudocode title="n-th Fibonacci Number with Bottom-up Approach - Space Optimized"
// fibonacci function
function fib(n: int) -> int:
    // initialize base cases
    let prev = 0
    let curr = 1

    // exceptional case for fib(0)
    if n == 0:
        return prev

    // calculate next values
    for i from 2 to n:
        let next = prev + curr
        prev = curr
        curr = next

    return curr
```

This approach still gives us a time complexity of $O(n)$ but reduces the space complexity to $O(1)$.

:::info Multiple Calls Optimization

The non-space optimized approach uses an memoization array, it can also be optimized for multiple calls.
However, the space optimized approach cannot be optimized for multiple calls, as it does not store all previous values.

    We start by building up from base cases to work towards the goal, iterating until we reach the goal.

In bottom-up approach, we start by doing what to work towards the goal?

## Impementation

Both the non-space optimized and space optimized approaches are implemented below.
They will be implemented for problems later on as well.
