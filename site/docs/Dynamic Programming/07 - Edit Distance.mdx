## Problem

This is a classic problem of dynamic programming to match 2 strings given 
a set of operations.

### Problem Description

Given 2 strings `s1` and `s2` and a set of operations:

- Insert a character
- Delete a character
- Replace a character

Find the minimum number of operations to make `s1` and `s2` equal.

Given:
- `0 <= s1.length, s2.length`

### Testcases

```testcase
Input: s1 = "horse", s2 = "ros"
Output: 3
```
The operations are:
1. horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
2. rorse -> rose (delete 'r')
3. rose -> ros (delete 'e')

```testcase
Input: s1 = "intention", s2 = "execution"
Output: 5
```
The operations are:
1. intention -> inention (delete 't')
2. inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
3. enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
4. exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
5. exection -> execution (insert 'u')
