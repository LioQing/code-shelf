## Problem

This is a type of problem where the goal is to maximize the profit
given a fixed-size capacity and a set of items with their weights and values.

### Problem Description

You are given a knapsack with a maximum weight capacity of $W$ and $n$ items
$V = \{(w_1, v_1), (w_2, v_2), ..., (w_n, v_n)\}$ where $w_i$ is the
weight of the $i$-th item and $v_i$ is the value of the $i$-th item.

You have to maximize the value of the knapsack by choosing some of the items
such that the total weight of the chosen items is less than or equal to $W$.

You either not choose an item, or choose it once.

Given:
- `0 <= W`
- `0 <= n`
- `0 <= w[i]`

### Testcases

```testcase
Input: W = 5, V = { (2, 20), (1, 10), (4, 30), (3, 15) }
Output: 40
```
The optimal choices are { 2, 3 }.<br/>
The total weight is 1 + 4 = 5.<br/>
The total value is 10 + 30 = 40.

```testcase
Input: W = 10, V = { (2, 10), (3, 15), (5, 20), (7, 30), (4, 12) }
Output: 45
```
The optimal choices are { 1, 2, 3 } or { 1, 2, 4 }.<br/>
The total weight is 3 + 7 = 10 or 2 + 3 + 5 = 10.<br/>
The total value is 15 + 30 = 45 or 10 + 15 + 20 = 45.

## Solution

This problem shows that the parameters may not only change by
a constant amount.

And here the parameters does not only mean the parameter of
the overall problem, but also the parameters of the subproblems.

### Subproblems

The most important part of this solution, is to recognize
that the parameters are interdependent.

We can see that at a given point, for example, with $W$ capacity
remaining, we have already decided on the items to take from the
first $i$ items.

From here, the optimal solution can be from the following previous
subproblems:

- With $W - w_i$ capacity remaining, we took the $i$-th item.
- With $W - w_{i-1}$ capacity remaining, we took the $i - 1$-th item.
- ... and so on.
- With $W - w_2$ capacity remaining, we took the $2$-nd item.
- With $W - w_1$ capacity remaining, we took the $1$-st item.
- With $W$ capacity remaining, we didn't take any item at all.

We can see the subproblems may change depending on the weight $w_i$ of
each item $i$.

We can apply a dynamic programming technique to the subproblems,
and know that the following part:

- With $W - w_{i-1}$ capacity remaining, we took the $i - 1$-th item.
- With $W - w_{i-2}$ capacity remaining, we took the $i - 2$-th item.
- ... and so on.
- With $W - w_2$ capacity remaining, we took the $2$-nd item.
- With $W - w_1$ capacity remaining, we took the $1$-st item.
- With $W$ capacity remaining, we didn't take any item at all.

is the subproblems when we have $W$ capacity remaining and already
decided on the items to take from the first $i - 1$ items, meaning
we didn't take the $i$-th item.

So the optimized subproblems are:

- With $W - w_i$ capacity remaining, we took the $i$-th item.
- With $W$ capacity remaining, we didn't take the $i$-th item.

### Recurrence Relation

The relation is simple, since we need the maximum value, we can
take the one with the maximum value among all the subproblems.

Let $f(i, W)$ be the maximum value we can get from the first $i$ items
with a capacity of $W$:

$$
f(i, W) = \max \begin{cases}
  f(i - 1, W - w_i) + v_i \\
  f(i - 1, W)
\end{cases}
$$

### Base Cases

The base cases for this problem is when we have no items left, or
when we have no capacity left.

In both cases, we be able to take any item and allocate to the capacity,
so the value is 0.

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(0, W) &= 0 \\
f(i, 0) &= 0
\end{aligned}
$$

### Edge Cases

Since we don't want the capacity to be negative, we need to exclude
cases if the capacity will become negative (or return 0 since it is
the smallest possible value).

$$
f(i, W) = \max \begin{cases}
  f(i - 1, W - w_i) + v_i & \text{if } W - w_i \ge 0 \\
  ...
\end{cases}
$$

### Solving the Problem

We can initialize the memoization array with 0, and skip the base
cases in the loop.

```pseudocode title="0-1 Knapsack Problem"
function zero_one_knapsack(W: int, V: (w: int, v: float)[]) {
    // problem size
    let n = V.length

    // initialize memoization array
    let dp = [...] of size (n + 1, W + 1)
             zero-based index
             initialized to 0
    
    // calcualate values
    for i from 1 to n {
        for w from 1 to W {
            if w - V[i].w >= 0 {
                dp[i][w] = max(
                    dp[i - 1][w - V[i].w] + V[i].v,
                    dp[i - 1][w],
                )
            } else {
                dp[i][w] = dp[i - 1][w]
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[n][W]
}
```

### Space Optimization

Since we only need the previous item's values to calculate
the next item's values, we can use a 1D array to store the
values.

However, since we may need the previous item's value at an
unknown index, we can use a copy of the previous array for
calculation to avoid getting overriden.

Here we will use a 2D array with 2 rows for better visualization.

```pseudocode title="0-1 Knapsack Problem - Space Optimized"
function zero_one_knapsack(W: int, V: (w: int, v: float)[]) {
    // problem size
    let n = V.length

    // initialize memoization array
    let dp = [...] of size (2, W + 1)
             zero-based index
             initialized to 0
    
    // calcualate values
    for i from 1 to n {
        // copy the previous row
        dp[0] = dp[1].copy()

        for w from 1 to W {
            if w - V[i].w >= 0 {
                dp[1][w] = max(
                    dp[0][w - V[i].w] + V[i].v,
                    dp[0][w],
                )
            } else {
                dp[1][w] = dp[0][w]
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[W]
}
```

:::info Possibility of Optimizing to $O(n)$ Space Complexity

We need to know which previous index value to take from the memoization
array, and the relation between current and previous index value must be
a constant for it to be optimizable.

However, $w$ does not meet these requirements, so it is not possible
to optimize out the $W$ in the space complexity.

We can use it on $i$ because we know it only need the $i-1$ value,
thus we are able to optimize out the $n$ in the space complexity.

        The position of one of the subproblems depends on the weight of the items,
