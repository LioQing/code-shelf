  <title>Introduction | Divide and Conquer</title>
</head>

Divide and Conquer is an algorithm design paradigm where the problem is
divided into smaller subproblems until the subproblems are trivial to
solve, then the solution of the subproblems are combined to give a
solution to the original problem.

Summation of all elements in an array is a good example of Divide and
Conquer.

Let $f(i, j)$ be the function that sums the elements between the 
$i$-th and $j$-th elements (inclusive) in an array $X = [x_1, x_2, ..., x_n]$:

$$
f(i, j) = x_i + x_{i+1} + ... + x_{j-1} + x_j
$$

The sum of all elements in $X$ is $f(1, n)$.

## Steps of Divide and Conquer

Steps of divide and conquer is as follows:

1. **Divide** the problem into smaller subproblems.
2. **Conquer** the subproblems by solving them recursively.
3. **Combine** the solutions of the subproblems to get the solution of the original problem.

## Apply on Summation

We can apply the steps of divide and conquer on the summation
function we have defined above.

We can see that summation of elements is the same as summation of the
first half adds to the summation of the second half.

By using this property, we can try to divide the problem into two halves,
and then add them up.

### Divide

We can divide the problem into two halves by dividing the summation into
two equal parts, by cutting them in the middle $\frac{i + k}{2}$

$$
f(i, j) = \left(x_i + x_{i+1} + ... + x_{\frac{i+j}{2}}\right) + \left(x_{\frac{i+j}{2}+1} + ... + x_{j-1} + x_j\right)
$$

### Conquer

We can solve the subproblems by solving them recursively, by calling
the summation function $f$ on the two halves.

And let's name the solved first and second halves $f_1$ and $f_2$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
f_1 &= f\left(i, \frac{i+j}{2}\right) \\
f_2 &= f\left(\frac{i+j}{2}+1, j\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

### Combine

We can combine the solutions of the subproblems by adding them up:

$$
f(i, j) = f_1 + f_2
$$

### Conclusion

This demonstrated the steps of divide and conquer on the summation
function.

We can see that the summation of all elements in an array can be solved
by applying the steps of divide and conquer.

:::info Strictness of Division

We are going to define index division simply as floor division $\left\lfloor \frac{i + j}{2} \right\rfloor$
throughout this topic for simplicity.

## Advantages

There are several advantages of divide and conquer, making it a very
common algorithm design paradigm, below are some of them.

### Efficiency

Divide and conquer is usually very efficient in solving specific
type of problems. For example, sorting algorithms that uses divide
and conquer like Merge Sort and Quick Sort are very efficient in sorting large arrays.

While the example of summation of all elements in an array done in divide and conquer
does not have any time nor space complixity reduced compared to simply summing
one by one from first to last. In some cases, divide and conquer can be a lot faster
than the linear solution.

### Parallelism

Since divide and conquer divides the problem into smaller subproblems to
be calculated independently, it is very easy to parallelize the
algorithm.

## Disadvantages

There are also several disadvantages of divide and conquer.

### Overhead

Divide and conquer usually has overhead in dividing and combining the
solutions of the subproblems.

Recursive solutions may also lead to overhead in function calls.

### Requires Independent Subproblems

Divide and conquer requires the subproblems to be independent of each
other, which is not always the case.

Even if it is possible, the division of independent subproblems may be hard to identify.

## Solutions

Here are some notes about the solutions in this topic.

### Steps

We will follow the definitive 3 steps of divide and conquer in this topic.

1. Divide
2. Conquer
3. Combine
